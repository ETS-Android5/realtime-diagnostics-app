Make sure you have Apache (Starting APACHE = "systemctl start httpd.service"

When you start a server make sure you enable cgi
	(enable cgi = "python3 -m http.server --bind localhost --cgi 8000")

Make sure you get rid of any escape sequences that might be in a string when you submit a form (I just used - .strip() - to get rid of anything)

Make sure you check that your apache instance and ur python directories are the same. (Check with import sys, sys.version, sys.prefix)
