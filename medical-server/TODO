REFRACTOR CODE - MAKE IT MORE MODULAR

Write some tests & documentation to make the code test and run with the arduino-defined SMS interfacer & Huawei one 

Write a requirements install for both the ubuntu environment and python install
(Potentially setup a virtualenv for python?)

Make an installer 

REMINDER: automatically start "mongod" at the start of every boot, to make recording/inserting processes instant:
This can be done pretty easily with ubuntu
